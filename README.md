# ASCII-Controller-GUI
Start games and software on Raspberry Pi using your game controller. Written in Python, using Curses library.

Originally meant to be used as a custom main GUI for RPI 3 B+ to run programs with an Xbox 360 controller. (for example, choosing between Retropie and Steam Link, or Desktop)


TODO

1. Make the font, button names and executable programs configurable
2. Reformat code to use Observer event system
3. Make following and previous buttons seeable 
4. Add visuals, fix border on RPI
5. Dont draw anyhing (or show custom error message) when terminal size is too small
6. Add how-to for setting Raspberry Pi to run the GUI after booting up.
